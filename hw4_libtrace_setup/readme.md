## Debug

1. wget and curl can't resolve host in WSL2 environment
    1. Edit `/etc/resolv.conf` as following:
        ```bash
        # This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
        # [network]
        # generateResolvConf = false
        nameserver 1.1.1.1
        ```
    1. Optional, edit `/etc/wsl.conf` to contain following network section:
        ```bash
        [network]
        generateResolveConf = false
        ```
        
## Commands

1. Changes monitoring: 
   ```bash
   while true; do sleep 1; clear; echo -e "/usr/local/include"; ls /usr/local/include; echo -e "\n/usr/local/lib"; ls /usr/local/lib; echo -e "\n/opt"; ls /opt; done
   ```
